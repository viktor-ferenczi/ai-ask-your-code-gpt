The project you've asked about is called LiteChain, and it's hosted on GitHub. Here's a brief summary based on the project structure and the README file:

- The project is written in multiple languages, including Python (.py), JavaScript (.js), and others.
- The README file provides a comprehensive guide on how to use LiteChain, including a quick install guide, examples of creating and interacting with a "Chain", and information on how to bring your own integration. It also mentions a roadmap for future development and guidelines for contributing to the project.
- The `setup.py` file indicates that this is a Python project that can be installed as a package. It contains various metadata about the project, including the author, description, license, and version.
- The project seems to be organized into several subdirectories, with the most relevant ones being `docs` (which likely contains documentation), `litechain` (which probably contains the core code of the project), and `tests` (which likely contains test cases).

To provide more detailed information, I can dive deeper into specific parts of the project. For example, I can summarize the `litechain` directory or search for specific code constructs or documentation. Please let me know what you're interested in.

List all the classes in the code of this package by walking all the directories with Python source code in them.

Here are the Python files found in the project and some of the classes they contain:

1. `/setup.py`: This file typically contains setup information for a Python package. It doesn't seem to contain any class definitions.

2. `/litechain/__init__.py`: This is the initialization file for the `litechain` package. It imports `Chain`, `ChainOutput`, and `SingleOutputChain` from `litechain.core.chain`.

3. `/litechain/contrib/__init__.py`: This is the initialization file for the `litechain.contrib` package. It imports `OpenAICompletionChain` and other classes from `litechain.contrib.llms.open_ai`.

4. `/litechain/core/chain.py`: This file contains the definition of the `ChainOutput` class.

Please note that this is not a comprehensive list of all classes in the project. The search results are limited to the first 100 results. If you want more detailed information about a specific class or file, please let me know.

Document the above classes in a concise way.

Here are the concise descriptions of the classes:

1. `ChainOutput`: This class represents the output of a Chain at each step. It has three attributes:
   - `chain`: The name of the chain that produced this output. This helps in identifying which part of the processing pipeline the output is coming from.
   - `data`: The actual output data produced by the Chain. This can be of any type produced by any step of the whole Chain.
   - `final`: A boolean flag indicating whether this output is the final output of the Chain. Only the outputs at the end of the chain are marked as "final".

   An example usage of `ChainOutput` is provided in the class docstring, showing how to create a chain and use it to process some input.

2. `OpenAICompletionChain`: This class uses the most simple Language Models from OpenAI based on GPT-3 for text completion. It takes a lambda function that should return a string with the prompt for completion. To use this chain, you will need an `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to be available. You can generate completions out of it. The class also provides an example of how to use it to generate a recipe.

   The `OpenAICompletionChain` class has the following attributes:
   - `name`: The name of the chain.
   - `call`: A callable that takes an input and returns a string, which is used as the prompt for the OpenAI completion.
   - `model`: The name of the OpenAI model to use for completions.
   - `temperature`: An optional parameter for the OpenAI completion API that controls the randomness of the output.
   - `max_tokens`: An optional parameter for the OpenAI completion API that controls the maximum length of the output.

   The class also defines an asynchronous generator function `completion` that uses the OpenAI API to generate completions for the given prompt.
